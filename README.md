##  Step 2: Booting Windows

Once your terminal is ready (usually takes 15-30 minutes to install):

*   **To start a fresh VM:** Type `start`. (The first boot will download the 23GB disk automatically if the initial install fails).
*   **To restore a backup:** Type `vm-import` and paste your link.

##  How to Access

After you run `start`, wait about 3-4 minutes for Windows to boot.

1.  **Browser Access (Methalo Browser):** Click the ports tab at the bottom and click on the Debug 8006 to see it booting, and then click on the 8008 Methalo Browser, and it'll take you to an IIS page. Then, in the search bar, add /myrtille/ to sign into it (e.g., `https://.../myrtille/`).

##  Export & Backup Feature

Since Codespaces are temporary, they will delete your data if they stop, and they stop after 30 minutes of inactivity (can be set to 240 minutes), so you can save and import the saved VM if you want to save data:

1.  Type **`vm-export`** in the terminal.
2.  Enter your **email address**.
3.  The system will upload your VM and email you a **Restore Link**.
4.  Next time you start a Codespace, use **`vm-import`** with that link to pick up exactly where you left off.
5.  If you don't want to stay and watch the VM save, then you can close the tab, and when it's done, a link will get sent to the email you put in
